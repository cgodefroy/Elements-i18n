Hi

Thank you for downloading Elements! 

Elements is a new Dropbox-powered text editor from Second Gear.  Elements allows you to view, edit and share plain text documents on your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch.  All of your data is stored on your personal Dropbox account.  

## Where do files go?

When you first log in, Elements creates a new folder called "Elements" in your Dropbox.  In the Elements folder should be a single file called "Welcome.txt".  That's the file you are reading right now!  

Any time you edit one of the text files in 'Elements' or on your Mac or PC, the changes will be pushed back to Dropbox and propogated back down.  Note: Dropbox isn't a true syncing platform, so you can't have multiple people working on the same file at different places at once. If, however, you're someone who writes a bit on your Mac and then packs the iPad for a trip to the coffee shop to continue, Elements is a perfect fit.

## Features

Elements includes just enough to support your writing without getting in your way:

* Create new files.
* Autosaving every sixty seconds (Network connection required).
* Word, character and line counts.
* A scratchpad for you to jot down notes and ideas as you're writing.  
* TextExpander touch support.  
* Email your files as attachments.

## Leave Us Reviews

If you like Elements, it would mean a lot if you would take the time to write a review on the App Store for others to see.  Reviews are a key part in ensuring the products success and our ability to release updates.  

We designed Elements to be a frictionless writing platform for ourselves and hope you enjoy using it too.
